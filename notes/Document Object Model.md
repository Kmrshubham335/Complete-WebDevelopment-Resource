# Document Object Model
DOM to access the document and its elements.
The DOM is not a programming language.
The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. 
The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to
the DOM in an internet browser.
# DOM can be modified by client-side JavaScript. 
Type the following into the console: **document.body**
