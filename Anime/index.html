                        Anime has been popular in Japan for almost a century. Its television shows and films have now
                        gained a foothold across the globe. America has been enjoying anime since the 1960s due to the
                        introduction of Speed Racer on American television. Studio Ghibli basked in a streak of box
                        office successes in the 1990s. At the 2001 Academy Awards, Spirited Away received an Oscar for
                        the best foreign-language picture.

            <h1>Difference between Anime and Cartoon</h1>
            <div class="section4">
                Anime and cartoons both are really popular for entertaining people through different platforms but
                people are really confused between these two terms, so letâ€™s understand the meaning of both of these in
                their classic sense.
                Anime is also understood as a visual representation of real-world objects or things but it provides
                semi-realistic touch to these objects or characters. Characters of anime are generally equivalent to
                humans in respect of their design.
                Cartoons can be defined as a visual representation of anything like a real-world character, objects and
                environments. These things are represented in an artistic form which is non-realistic in nature, one can
                easily identify these by their unusual designs.
