In CSS, when you use flex: 1; as a shorthand property within a flex container, you are setting the flexibility of a flex item. The flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.
Here's the breakdown of flex: 1:
flex-grow: This property determines how much a flex item should grow relative to the other flex items in the same container. The value 1 means that the item will grow to fill any available space, taking up an equal share of the available space with other items that also have a flex-grow value of 1.
flex-shrink: This property defines how much a flex item should shrink if there is not enough space in the flex container. The value 1 means that the item will shrink proportionally to the other items with a flex-shrink value of 1.
flex-basis: This property sets the initial size of a flex item. In the case of flex: 1;, it implies flex-basis: 0%;, which means the initial size of the item is 0% of the container's size.
So, flex: 1; is commonly used to make flex items within the same container share available space equally, and it is a concise way of expressing that each item should grow and shrink based on the available space

1. **API Integration:**
 I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API (`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`) into my Weather App. This API allows me to fetch real-time weather data for a given location, providing accurate and up-to-date information.

2. **Async/Await:**
   - I utilized the `async/await` syntax in the `check_Weather` function. This modern JavaScript feature allows me to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and sequential manner. The `await` keyword ensures that the code waits for the asynchronous task (API call, in this case) to complete before moving on to the next step.

3. **DOM Manipulation:**
   - I employed JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) based on the weather data received from the API. This includes updating the city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and selecting the appropriate weather icon. DOM manipulation is a fundamental skill in web development for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

4. **Event Handling:**
   - I added an event listener to the search button, allowing users to trigger the weather check by clicking the button. This event-driven approach is common in web development and ensures that specific actions are taken in response to user interactions.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - While fetching data from the API, I recognized the importance of error handling. For instance, if the city name provided by the user is not valid, the API may return an error. Implementing error handling is crucial for a robust application, ensuring a graceful response in case of unexpected situations.

6. **Path to Image Files:**
   - I noticed a small typo in my code: `weatherIcon.scr` should be `weatherIcon.src`. This correction is vital for properly loading weather icons. It's crucial to pay attention to such details to prevent issues with image loading.

7. **Relative Paths:**
   - I considered using relative paths for my image files instead of absolute paths. This practice enhances the portability of my project. For example, `"./img/clouds.png"` indicates that the image is located in the "img" folder within the current directory.

8. **Consistent File Naming:**
   - I emphasized the importance of maintaining consistent file naming conventions throughout my project. Having variations in file names, such as `clouds.png` and `clear.png`, can lead to confusion and potential errors. Consistency promotes better organization and ease of maintenance.
